Based on the open source watchface [Planets, by Alex Karantza](https://github.com/karantza/Planets_PebbleFace), the Spacewalk team created a new, high-information-density, eminently glanceable face for the Pebble smartwatch platform. Powered by Dark Sky weather data and using a custom weather backend written in Python and Javascript, the face, written in C, features a 24 hour timeline of weather forecast, including temperature, cloud cover, precipitation, and wind data. It's customizable, regularly updated, and [free and open-source.](https://github.com/elementc/luminosity)
